    All three pigs decide to build a house, and set off to the brick works to buy some bricks.<br><br>
    But soon the hree little pigs came across a Man carrying a bundle of straw.<br><br>
    The first little pig said to himself :<br><br>
    "Now I won't need to walk so far to the brickworks! I'd much rather do less work, and then spend the rest of my afternoon relaxing."<br><br>
    So the first little pig said to the Man carrying straw :<br><br>
    "Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house."<br><br>
    The Man did, and the little Pig quickly built a house with it right where he stood, and then settled down and prepared to have a sleep for the rest of the afternoon<br><br>
    Presently came along a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in."<br><br>
